The following must be installed before using the Acronym Interface Package:

In order to use this script, you must have several programs already installed on your computer. These are described
below, but are listed here:
pydicom - Python module, used for manipulation of DICOM files
dcm2niix - program for converting DICOM files to NIfTI files
sshpass - this allows for the script to use your Icarus login/password to send file backups to Icarus

***NOTE***
If you are running this script on Pegasus, all of the necessary installations from above have already been performed.

##########################################################

To rename DICOM folders, you must install the pydicom module for python. This can be done by typing the following
command into Terminal:

pip install pydicom

##########################################################

In order to convert files from DICOM to NIfTI (.nii), you need to have dcm2niix installed
(https://www.nitrc.org/projects/dcm2nii/).

***IMPORTANT: Previous versions of Data_Prep.py (called Data_Processing.py) have used dcm2nii, a deprecated version of this tool.
Make sure that you have dcm2niix (ending in x) installed and set up in order for this script to work. The previous
version required manual modification of a preferences file in order to achieve the desired output; that is no longer
necessary.

(As a note, DICOM to NIfTI conversion can be performed manually using the MRIcroGL GUI, or through the command line.)

If you installed dcm2niix in your Applications folder, no further steps are necessary.
If you chose a different folder, you will need to edit the Data_Prep.py script with the correct folder (line 99).

##########################################################
In order to back up data to Icarus, you will need to install sshpass.
Instructions can be found here:
https://sourceforge.net/projects/sshpass/

sshpass must be installed in /usr/local/bin/
